1. start the mongodb cluster: docker-compose up
2. start clients / consistency checker: cd client && ./build-run-clj.sh
3. figure out who is the primary: ./primary.sh
4. isolate the primary (in my case it's node1): ./isolate.sh node1
5. wait ~20 seconds
6. heal the network: ./rejoin.sh node1
7. figure out who is the primary: ./primary.sh
8. isolate the primary (in my case it's node2): ./isolate.sh node2
9. wait ~20 seconds
10. heal the network: ./rejoin.sh node2
11. observe the violation
